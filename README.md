# Daily Random Stock
There are thousands of publicly traded companies in the US. Most investors concentrate their efforts on the well-known stocks - don't be like them! There may be better investment opportunities in companies you have never heard of before. I created Daily Random Stock to showcase 1 of the over 3,000 companies on the biggest US exchanges each day. No media bias here! It may take a few seconds to load up.

This is a fully automatic interactive program that uses R Markdown, Shiny, and several useful R packages to display information from Quandl (and soon other sources) about a random stock. It is automatic because it will select a new stock and update on it's own each day.
